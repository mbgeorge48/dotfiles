Has my vscode extensions
Install the extensions
vscode settings

## Visual Studio Code

Contains a working copy of my vscode settings

- need to work out how to symlink the file, currently it lives here on mac:
  - ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json

All the extensions I'm currently running, not something that can be symlinked I believe so will have to just keep up to date manually
